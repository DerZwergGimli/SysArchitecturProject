# Vehicle-Emulator
## This is a SysArchitecturProject

This is our version of a vehicle in Java RT Vehicle compiled with [JamaicaVM form aicas](https://www.aicas.com/cms/) to gain Realtime behavior. Note that this is just a testing environment for a Raspberry PI. You will need to flash an RPI with a Raspbian image and you should be ready to go.
   
More information you can find in our [wiki](https://github.com/DerZwergGimli/SysArchitecturProject/wiki).
